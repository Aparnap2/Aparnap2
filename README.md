## Aparna Pradhan — Full‑Stack Web & React Native Developer | AI Agents & SaaS Specialist


### I build production‑ready MVPs and AI‑driven systems for founders and SMBs.
### Full‑stack web, React Native, and agentic AI with reliable integrations and secure, typed data flows.

### About
I’m Aparna Pradhan, a full‑stack developer focused on shipping robust MVPs and agentic AI systems that stand up in production. I combine strong fundamentals (typed contracts, predictable data pipelines, secure integrations) with modern tooling (LangGraph, OpenRouter, React/Next.js, FastAPI/NestJS) to turn ambiguous ideas into working software that users actually adopt.

What I’m known for
- Shipping MVPs fast without cutting corners on reliability
- Building autonomous agents with guardrails, typed schemas, and tool contracts
- Designing generative UI that turns chat into action (cards, forms, tables, charts)
- Integrating cleanly with real systems (auth, payments, files, CRMs, CMS, search)

Focus Areas
- AI Agents & Automation: LangGraph‑orchestrated workflows, tool use, secure actions
- SaaS Platforms: Multi‑tenant, billing, analytics, admin, role‑based access
- Mobile Apps: React Native experiences with offline‑first and AI features
- Knowledge & Data: RAG pipelines, vector search, graph memory, NL→API/SQL
- Dev Experience: Typed contracts (TypeScript/Pydantic), CI/CD, containerized deploys

Core Tech Stack (Evergreen)
- Frontend: React, Next.js, React Native, TypeScript, Tailwind, Zustand, TanStack Query
- Backend: Node.js/NestJS, Python/FastAPI, GraphQL/REST, Webhooks, Serverless/Edge
- Data: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Prisma/Drizzle, Redis, Supabase
- AI: LangGraph, LangChain, OpenRouter model routing, RAG (Qdrant/Pinecone), LlamaIndex
- Graph & Memory: Neo4j (relationship/temporal memory)
- DevOps: Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), Vercel, AWS basics, Nginx
- Integrations: Shopify/WooCommerce (dev/test), Stripe (test), Zendesk/Freshdesk, Notion/Confluence, Email/Slack
- Reliability: Typed schemas (Zod/Pydantic), observability, audit trails

Flagship Projects (Positioned as ongoing capabilities)
- Generative UI Support Agent
  Scope: Autonomous customer support across orders, refunds, product info with LangGraph, typed tools, and dynamic UI components. Integrations: Shopify/WooCommerce (dev), Stripe (test), ticketing.
  Value: Sub‑2s responses, 70–95% autonomous resolution, measurable deflection.
- SaaS Chatbot/Agent Builder
  Scope: Multi‑tenant platform to deploy domain chatbots/agents with analytics, knowledge ingestion, policies, and guardrails. RAG pipelines, role‑based access, usage metering.
  Value: Fast deployment, reproducible playbooks, auditability.
- AI Virtual Office (Agentic Workflows)
  Scope: Calendar/tasks orchestration, procedural agents with tool use, summary digests, and human‑in‑the‑loop optionality. LangGraph state + secure actions.
  Value: Hours saved weekly, reliable automations that survive API changes.
- Research Copilot (NotebookLM‑style, self‑hostable)
  Scope: PDF/web ingestion, source‑grounded summaries, citations, topic maps, graph memory.
  Value: Trustworthy research with at‑source traceability.

Services (Evergreen, non‑time‑sensitive)
- Autonomous Agent Systems
  Design and implementation of LangGraph‑based agents with typed tool contracts, guardrails, and streaming generative UI. Outcomes over prompts.
- SaaS MVPs
  From schema and auth to billing, analytics, and admin—production‑ready in weeks, not months.
- Mobile + AI
  React Native apps with on‑device UX, offline‑first, and AI features (OCR, RAG, assistants).
- Knowledge & Data
  RAG pipelines, governed retrieval, vector/graph stores, and measurable answer quality.

Engagement Models (No volatile price numbers)
- Sprint: Discovery → Blueprint → Working Prototype (2–3 weeks)
- Build: Milestone‑based delivery with clear acceptance criteria and metrics
- Evolve: Ongoing improvements (monitoring, guardrails, features) with optional retainer

Principles I don’t compromise on
- Predictability: Typed data flows end‑to‑end (TypeScript/Zod/Pydantic)
- Security: Least privilege, audit logs, field‑level protection where needed
- Observability: Metrics, traces, and evaluations for agent behavior
- Ownership: Code‑first, no lock‑in; your team can extend and maintain

Selected Skills & Proof
- Full‑stack execution: Multiple MVPs from zero→users with clean, extensible codebases
- Agentic AI: LangGraph orchestration, tool use, confidence thresholds, fallbacks
- Integrations: Payments, shops, ticketing, auth, knowledge bases, storage, email
- Data UX: Generative UI that moves beyond chat to actionable interfaces

Collaboration
I work best with founders and teams who value:
- Clear scope → reliable delivery
- Outcomes > demos
- Sustainable systems over throwaway prototypes
