## Aparna Pradhan — Code‑First Automation Modernization | Full‑Stack & AI Agents

I modernize brittle, legacy/no‑code automations into reliable, scalable, cost‑efficient systems with SLAs, acceptance tests, and live ROI dashboards. Outcomes over demos. Governance over hype.

### What I do
- Modernize support, bookings, and finance inbox workflows with orchestrated agents, validators, and observability.  
- Ship production‑ready SaaS/Mobile features (auth, billing, analytics, admin, role‑based access).  
- Prove success with binary acceptance tests, P95 latency targets, and a 30‑day L2 warranty.

### Outcomes (representative targets)
- Support: P95 first response < 2 minutes; ≥85% QA pass on 100 historical emails; ≥95% citation coverage; breach alerts < 30s.  
- Booking: calendar write < 60s; +20% show‑rate vs 30‑day baseline; response P95 < 2 minutes.  
- Finance inbox: ≥98% field accuracy on 200‑doc test; 100% duplicate detection on seeded sample; weekly anomaly digest by 9am Monday.

### About
Full‑stack developer specialized in agentic AI and code‑first systems. Strong fundamentals (typed contracts, predictable data pipelines, secure integrations) plus modern orchestration (LangGraph, evaluators/validators, temporal KBs with citations). Clear definitions of done, measurable ROI, and production reliability.

### Focus areas
- Code‑First Modernization: state machines, retries/idempotency, queue/outbox, structured logs, rollback.  
- Agentic AI: LangGraph orchestration, tool contracts, confidence thresholds, HITL options.  
- SaaS Platforms: multi‑tenant architecture, billing, analytics, admin, RBAC.  
- Mobile + AI: React Native experiences with offline‑first and on‑device friendly UX.  
- Knowledge & Data: RAG pipelines, vector/graph stores, governed retrieval, NL→API/SQL.

### Core stack
- Frontend: React, Next.js, React Native, TypeScript, Tailwind, TanStack Query, Zustand.  
- Backend: Node.js/NestJS, Python/FastAPI, REST/GraphQL, Webhooks, Serverless/Edge.  
- Data: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Prisma/Drizzle, Redis, Supabase.  
- AI: LangGraph/LangChain, OpenRouter routing, RAG (Qdrant/Pinecone), LlamaIndex.  
- Graph & Memory: Neo4j (relationship/temporal memory).  
- DevOps: Docker, GitHub Actions, Vercel, AWS basics, Nginx.  
- Integrations: Shopify/WooCommerce, Stripe, Zendesk/Freshdesk, Notion/Confluence, Email/Slack.  
- Reliability: Zod/Pydantic schemas, observability, audit trails.

### Flagship capabilities
- Generative Support Workforce  
  Scope: Email/WhatsApp answers with citations, QA gate, SLA/breach alerts, sentiment routing.  
  Value: measurable deflection, P95 latency targets, governed escalation.

- Booking & Lead Ops Workforce  
  Scope: IG/WhatsApp/email intake → qualifier → slot picker → reminders → no‑show guardrails.  
  Value: more bookings, higher show‑rates, admin for hours/prompts, idempotent writes.

- Finance Inbox (AP/AR Lite)  
  Scope: Docling OCR + validators, anomaly digest (duplicates/tax), NL reconciliation, CSV/ERP export (read‑only first).  
  Value: accuracy and duplicate‑catch guarantees, weekly digest, clean hand‑off to accounting.

- Research Copilot (Notebook‑style, self‑hostable)  
  Scope: PDF/web ingestion, source‑grounded summaries, topic maps, graph memory.  
  Value: trustworthy research with at‑source traceability and evaluators.

### Services
- 10‑Day Modernization Audit (required first step)  
  Journey map, latency/cost/failure baselines, SLAs, acceptance tests, 90‑day roadmap, and a fixed 10–14 day pilot SOW (fee credited to build).

- Pilot Build (10–14 days, pass/fail)  
  One workflow rebuilt with orchestrated agents, validators, observability, and a live ROI panel; keep/kill at day 14; 30‑day L2 warranty.

- Ongoing Ops  
  Monthly SLOs, dashboards (P95, cost/100 actions, outcome metric), incident playbooks, and change‑managed improvements.

### Engagement models
- Sprint: Discovery → Blueprint → Working Prototype (2–3 weeks).  
- Build: Milestone‑based delivery with acceptance criteria and metrics.  
- Evolve: Retainer for monitoring, guardrails, and roadmap features.

### Principles
- Predictability: typed data flows end‑to‑end (TypeScript/Zod/Pydantic).  
- Security: least privilege, audit logs, process‑and‑delete mode on request.  
- Observability: metrics, traces, evaluations, and breach playbooks.  
- Ownership: code‑first, no lock‑in; your team can extend and maintain.

### Proof and signals
- Test harnesses with screenshots for Support/Booking/Finance acceptance runs.  
- Redacted dashboard images (P95 latency, cost/100 actions, outcome metrics).  
- TCO mini‑cards showing legacy/no‑code monthly vs code‑first run‑rate and payback months.

### Collaboration fit
Best with ops‑minded founders and teams that value clear scope, fast time‑to‑value, and sustainable systems over throwaway prototypes.
